modify predefined rule : 
DC min max is based on the platorm idt
but, what if it is not the platorm idt, i.e. from custom idt (prmitive custom idt)
if M column of adt_primitive containing the value from C column of IDT , then look for corresponding IDT which is in E column of idt sheet and based on that decide min max
 
Rule no next 
init value rule _
 
init value should be within its DC range
 
J column of ports and E column of ib_data value should be within its DC range
how to see the DC range 
1. for E column of ib_data
corresponding D column value 
	a. platorm idt (uint8 - 0 to 255)
	b. custom idt - type primitive then direct look into E column of idt sheet and decide min max based on that
					type ARRAY_VARIABLE or ARRAY_FIXED then direct look into E column of idt sheet and decide min max based on that
					type RECORD then check each value separated by comma and its limit respectively based on its corresponding E column of idt sheet and decide min max based on that
	c.primitive ADT - look into corresponding K and L comumn of adt_primitive for min max value 
	D. composite ADT - RECORD - then check each value separated by comma and its data type that is F column value of composite sheet 
									if 	APDT - look into corresponding K and L comumn of adt_primitive for min max value 
										ARDT - round and round 
										AADT - look below for the logic
						ARRAY - prmitive - look into corresponding K and L comumn of adt_primitive for min max value 
								record -round and round
								array - round and round
